# 1. Business Context: The Aurelia Ventures Case Study

This document provides a detailed background on the business drivers, strategic goals, and target audience for the Aurelia Ventures Customer Segmentation Dashboard.

## Problem Statement

Aurelia Ventures, a B2B distribution company, successfully scaled its operations and grew its customer base. However, this growth came with increasing complexity and diminishing marginal returns. The company's sales and marketing efforts were spread thinly across all customers, lacking focus and strategic direction. This led to several critical business challenges:

*   **Profit Leakage:** High-cost sales activities were being applied to low-margin customers, eroding overall profitability.
*   **Customer Churn Risk:** High-value "Top Clients" were not receiving the specialized attention they deserved, putting key accounts at risk.
*   **Ineffective Marketing:** Generic marketing campaigns failed to resonate with the diverse needs of different customer types.
*   **Lack of Strategic Insight:** The leadership team could not easily identify which customer relationships to nurture, grow, or simply maintain.

## Project Goals & Objectives

The primary goal of this project was to provide strategic clarity by segmenting the customer base into actionable tiers. The specific objectives were:

*   **Implement a Pareto Analysis:** Apply a data-driven methodology to identify the vital few customers (the 20%) who drive the majority of business results (the 80%).
*   **Develop Customer Profiles:** Go beyond simple segmentation by visualizing the unique purchasing behaviors and geographic footprints of each segment.
*   **Create an Interactive Strategic Tool:** Build a dashboard that allows managers to dynamically explore each segment and its contribution to KPIs like `Total Sales`, `Total Profits`, and `Average Transaction` size.
*   **Enable Data-Driven Decision-Making:** Provide a clear, quantitative foundation for tailoring sales strategies, marketing messages, and service levels to each customer segment.

## Target Audience

This dashboard is designed primarily for strategic leaders within Aurelia Ventures:

*   **Sales Directors & VPs:** To direct their teams' efforts, set focused targets, and design incentive plans based on customer value.
*   **Marketing Managers:** To create targeted campaigns and messaging that resonate with the specific needs of each segment.
*   **C-Level Executives (CEO, CSO):** To gain a high-level understanding of the company's customer portfolio and guide long-term growth strategy.
